#  Play’n GO Rolls Out Casino Slot Games

Swedish casino games developer Play’n GO has announced the launch of six new casino slot games. The games, which are based on popular Norse mythology, will be made available to operators in regulated markets worldwide.

The new titles are: Valkyrie Queen, Golden Ticket, Grim Muerto, Hugo Goal, Luchadora and Leprechaun Goes to Hell. Each game offers a different theme and set of bonus features, making them suitable for players of all levels of experience.

Commenting on the launch, Play’n GO CEO Johan Törnqvist said: “We are very excited to introduce these new slot games to the market. They have been designed to appeal to a wide range of players, and we believe they will be a big hit both with experienced gamers and those who are new to casino gaming.”

The new games are already available at several leading online casinos, including Mr Green and Videoslots.

#  Play’n GO Powers Up Bitcoin Gambling

The Swedish game developer Play’n GO has announced that it will start accepting Bitcoin payments for its online casino games. The move means that players can now use the cryptocurrency to buy in-game credits and enjoy all of Play’n GO’s popular titles, including the new Raging Rex slot game.

Bitcoin is a digital currency that was first released in 2009. Unlike traditional currencies, which are controlled by governments and banks, Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning that it is not subject to any outside control. This makes it attractive to many online gamers who appreciate the security and anonymity that it offers.

Bitcoin payments are processed through a system called blockchain, which is a digital ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions. This means that there is no need for third-party payment processors, making the process simple and fast.

Play’n GO CEO Johan Törnqvist said of the move: “As one of the pioneers in iGaming, we are always keen to explore new technologies and opportunities to offer our customers the best possible gaming experience. Accepting Bitcoin payments is a natural progression for us as we aim to provide a seamless gaming experience across all channels and devices.”

The news comes at a time when interest in Bitcoin is increasing rapidly. The value of Bitcoin has risen by over 600% in the past 12 months, making it one of the most profitable investment options around. This has led to an increase in demand from online gamers who are looking for ways to use their Bitcoins to gamble online.

#  Play’n GO Goes Live With Launch of New Casino Website

Casino gaming provider Play’n GO has announced the launch of its new casino website. The new site, which is now live, is designed to provide an enhanced player experience, with a streamlined layout and a wealth of content.

The site offers players access to a range of Play’n GO games, including popular video slots such as Book of Dead, Moon Princess and Golden Princess. New players can also take advantage of a generous welcome offer which gives them up to €1,000 in bonus money plus 150 free spins.

Henrik Tjärnström, CEO at Play’n GO, commented on the launch: “We are really excited to launch our new website. The site has been completely redesigned with the player in mind, and we believe that players will enjoy the great selection of games and the enhanced user experience. We look forward to welcoming new and existing players to our site in the coming weeks and months.”

In addition to its new website, Play’n GO is also set to release several new games in the coming weeks and months, including a slot based on the popular TV series Game of Thrones.
