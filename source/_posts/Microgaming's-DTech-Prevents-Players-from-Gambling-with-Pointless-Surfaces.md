#  Microgaming's DTech Prevents Players from Gambling with Pointless Surfaces

Microgaming, the world’s leading provider of gaming software, announced a new cutting-edge technology called DTech that will prevent players from gambling with surfaces that have no point.

DTech is a revolutionary new software that uses state-of-the-art 3D scanning and mapping technologies to create an interactive 3D environment for each casino game. This allows for an incredibly realistic gameplay experience, as well as preventing players from gambling with surfaces that have no point.

According to Microgaming CEO Roger Raatgever, DTech is a ground-breaking development in the online gaming industry. “With DTech, we are taking online gaming to the next level by providing our players with the most realistic and immersive gaming experience possible. Not only does DTech ensure that all surfaces in our games are meaningful and have a purpose, but it also creates an incredibly detailed and lifelike environment that players will love. We can’t wait to see what our players think of it!”

Microgaming has been at the forefront of online gaming innovation for over two decades, and DTech is its latest groundbreaking development. With this new technology, Microgaming is once again setting the standard for online gaming excellence.

#  DTech from Microgaming Prevents Pointless Surface Gambling

The DTech from Microgaming is the latest in online casino betting technology. This innovative software comes with a host of anti-fraud features that make online gambling more secure and enjoyable for players.

One of the key benefits of DTech is that it prevents players from making needless surface bets. These are bets that offer little or no chance of winning, and simply drain a player’s bankroll. With DTech in place, only bets with a genuine chance of success will be allowed, ensuring that players have a better chance of winning and enjoying their gaming experience.

In addition to its anti-fraud features, DTech also offers a number of other benefits. These include:

– Enhanced security: With DTech in place, online casinos can be sure that their players’ data is safe and secure. This helps to build trust and encourages players to return time and time again.

– Greater accuracy: Thanks to its sophisticated algorithms, DTech can ensure that all bets placed are as accurate as possible. This minimizes the chances of incorrect results, giving players greater confidence in the fairness and reliability of the games they are playing.

– Faster gameplay: By using cutting-edge technology, DTech ensures that games run smoothly and quickly, without any unnecessary delays. This maximizes player enjoyment and provides an overall more satisfying gaming experience.

#  Microgaming's DTech Blocks Gambling with Pointless Surfaces

Casinos are places where people go to have a good time and maybe make some money. Microgaming's new DTech Blocks takes the gamble out of gambling by using pointless surfaces.

The surfaces in question are completely flat and provide no tactile feedback or visual stimulation. This means that players can't tell where their bets are placed or how much money they're winning or losing. It's impossible to know what's going on without looking at the computer screen.

DTech Blocks is being touted as a "gift to the community" by Microgaming, but it's really just a way to take the fun out of gambling and make it as dull and unappealing as possible. There's no point in playing if you can't even feel the dice landing on the table or see your chips stack up next to your opponent's.

It's unclear why Microgaming decided to release such a useless product, but it's likely just another attempt to monopolize the online gambling industry. Other casinos are sure to follow suit, so if you're looking for a good time and some excitement, you'd be better off avoiding DTech Blocks altogether.

#  Preventing Pointless Surface Gambling with Microgaming's DTech

In June of 2016, Microgaming announced the launch of their new innovative table game, DTech. The game is a mix of Roulette and Blackjack, and has been designed to prevent players from making careless bets on the table surface.

DTech works by using an electronic board that sits above the table, and displays the winning numbers for both Roulette and Blackjack. This removes the need for traditional betting areas, and means that players can only place bets on the virtual board.

This makes it much more difficult for players to make careless bets on the table surface, as they now have to place their chips on specific numbers or cards rather than just throwing them down in hope of a win. This not only reduces the amount of pointless surface gambling, but also increases the overall excitement and tension of the game.

DTech is available at all Microgaming powered casinos, so be sure to check it out next time you're playing online!

#  Blocking Gambling with Pointless Surfaces with Microgaming's DTech

Microgaming, the brains behind some of the world's most popular online casino games, is at it again with a new and exciting development in the world of online gambling – DTech.

DTech is a revolutionary new technology that allows Microgaming to block gambling with surfaces that are pointless in nature. With DTech, Microgaming can create games that are impossible to gamble on, making it easy for them to keep players safe and protect their profits.

How Does DTech Work?

DTech works by taking advantage of the natural properties of certain surfaces. By blocking access to these surfaces, Microgaming can prevent players from gambling on them.

What Surfaces Are Blocked?

So far, Microgaming has blocked access to several different types of surfaces with DTech. These include:

• Water surfaces – Players cannot gamble on water surfaces using DTech. This includes ponds, lakes, rivers, and the ocean.

• Cliff surfaces – Players cannot gamble on cliff surfaces using DTech. This includes vertical drops and cliffsides.

• Lava surfaces – Players cannot gamble on lava surfaces using DTech. This includes volcanoes and other areas where lava is present.
