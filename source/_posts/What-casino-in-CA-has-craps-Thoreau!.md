# How to Play Craps

To play craps, you first need to place a bet. You can bet on the roll of the dice or on the outcome of other players' rolls. Then, one player (the shooter) rolls two dice. If the total is 7 or 11, they win and their bet is doubled. If the total is 2, 3, or 12, they lose and their bet is forfeited. If the total is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, that's called a "point". The shooter keeps rolling until they either get a 7 or the point again; if they get a 7 first, they lose and their bet is forfeited, but if they get the point again then they win. There are lots of other bets you can make as well; for more information visit our website or give us a call today!
