#  FFXIV Blackjack: When Is The Daily Roulette Reset?

Blackjack is a popular casino game that can be found in most online and land-based casinos. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by getting 21 points on the player's first two cards, without going over 21. or by having the dealer go over 21. In Blackjack, points are Ace = 1, 2 through 10 = Face value, and Jack, Queen, King = 10.

In FFXIV Blackjack, also called Eorzea Blackjack, the rules are similar to those of classic blackjack with a few exceptions. The game is played with six decks of cards (108 cards). After the player places their bet, they are dealt two cards face up. The dealer is then dealt two cards face down and one card face up. The aim of the game is to reach 21 or beat the dealers hand without going over 21.

In FFXIV Blackjack each card has a numerical value as well as a suit (spades, hearts, clubs or diamonds). The suits have no bearing on the outcome of the hand; only the numerical values are used. Spades are worth 1 point, hearts are worth 2 points, clubs are worth 3 points and diamonds are worth 4 points. Aces can be either 1 or 11 points, depending on what makes a better hand.

If you have more than 21 points then you bust and lose regardless of what the dealer does. If you have less than 21 points then your hand is compared to the dealers hand to see who wins. Winning hands pay out at even money - that is, if you bet 100 gil and win you get back 100 gil plus your original bet back. In addition there are various side bets available which can payout more lucrative sums depending on the particular variant you're playing. If both you and the dealer have exactly 21 then it's a tie or push and no one wins or loses money on that particular bet.

Now that we know how to play let's take a look at some important strategy considerations:

# When to hit and when to stand

Generally speaking you want to hit when your total is below 17 and stand when your total is 17 or above. This isn't set in stone however - sometimes it's better to hit with a total of 18 for example if the dealer has a low card showing (2-6). Similarly if your total is close to 21 then it might be wise to stand instead of hitting in case you go over 21 and lose automatically. Remember that these guidelines are just a starting point - use your own judgement based on what's happening in the game too.

# Taking insurance







 







 

  

  

  Insurance is an optional side wager available in blackjack which pays out 2:1 if the dealer has blackjack (meaning their first two cards add up to 21). It's basically a way of hedging your bets by protecting yourself against getting blackjacked yourself! Most casinos advise not taking insurance but it's ultimately up to you whether or not you want to do so - just be aware that if the dealer doesn’t have blackjack then you lose this bet outright.

#  What Time Does The Daily Roulette Reset In FFXIV Blackjack?

In Final Fantasy XIV blackjack, the goal is to beat the dealer by collecting cards that total 21 or less, without going over. Unlike regular blackjack, players are not allowed to split or double down. The game resets at midnight server time.

The dealer stands on all 17s and players can hit as many times as they'd like as long as they don't bust (go over 21). The first player to reach 21 or less wins the hand. In the event of a tie, the player with the highest card value (Aces are high) wins.

Blackjack pays 3:2 on winning hands, so a $10 bet would pay out $15. However, if you were to wager $5 on each hand and win both, you would walk away with $10 in your pocket - not too bad!

#  When Will The Daily Roulette Reset In FFXIV Blackjack?

The roulette in Final Fantasy XIV Blackjack will reset every day at 6:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time. This is the time that the game server updates, so it's necessary for the roulette to reset then as well. The time may vary depending on your location, so be sure to check what time the reset occurs in your region.

The reset time is also when your Daily Quests resets, so you can try for a higher score each day. The rewards for these quests increase each day, so it's definitely worth trying to get a higher score each day.
