#  Which states outlaw gambling and what are the penalties?

Gambling is outlawed in a total of six U.S. states. The penalties for gambling can vary, but typically include either a misdemeanor or felony charge, as well as fines and/or imprisonment.

The six states that outlaw gambling are: Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. In Idaho and Indiana, gambling is considered a Class D felony, punishable by up to three years imprisonment and/or a $10,000 fine. In Louisiana, it is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months imprisonment and/or a $500 fine. Gambling is a misdemeanor in Oregon punishable by up to six months imprisonment and/or a $1,000 fine. And in Washington it is also a misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days imprisonment and/or a $1,000 fine.

#  Is your state one of the many that outlaw gambling?

Out of the 50 states in the US, only Utah and Hawaii outlaw all forms of gambling. The rest have a variety of laws that allow different types of gambling, from state-run lotteries to tribal casinos.

States make money from gambling in different ways. Some, like Delaware, get a percentage of each bet placed in their state. Others, like New Jersey, levy taxes on casino revenue. States also earn money from lottery ticket sales.

The potential revenue from gambling has many states rethinking their stance on the issue. In 2012, Nevada made $1 billion from gambling and its lawmakers are looking for ways to increase that number. In Pennsylvania, lawmakers are considering legalizing online poker in order to bring in more revenue.

Even states without casinos or lotteries can benefit from gambling. For example, West Virginia has neither, but it is home to a racetrack with video slot machines. These machines generate over $200 million per year for the stateâ€™s budget.

Gambling is a major source of revenue for many states and it looks like that number will continue to grow.
