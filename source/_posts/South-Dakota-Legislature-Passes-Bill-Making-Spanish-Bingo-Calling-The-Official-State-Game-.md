#  South Dakota Legislature Passes Bill Making Spanish Bingo Calling The Official State Game 

In a unanimous vote on Tuesday, the South Dakota Legislature passed a bill making Spanish bingo calling the official state game.

The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Henry Schieman (R-District 7), said the idea for the bill came about last year when constituent Larry Zimmerman brought it to his attention. Zimmerman is of German descent but he and his wife Dolores both enjoy playing Spanish bingo, which they learned how to play while living in Texas.

“I always try to listen to my constituents, and if they have an idea that I think is a good one, I’ll do what I can to support it,” Schieman said.

Zimmerman was thrilled with the passage of the bill.

“I’m just so happy that our state legislators recognized the importance of this issue and took bipartisan action to make Spanish bingo calling the official state game,” Zimmerman said. “This will help ensure that future generations in South Dakota will be able to enjoy this fun tradition too.”

Opponents of the bill argued that it would be more costly for casinos to staff bilingual callers, but supporters maintained that the extra expense would be worth it in order to ensure that all residents of South Dakota have access to this cultural activity.

Governor Kristi Noem is expected to sign the bill into law shortly.

#  South Dakota Considers Spanish Bingo Calling The Official State Game 

In South Dakota, lawmakers are considering a bill that would designate Spanish bingo calling as the official state game.

The legislation was introduced by Republican Rep. Dean Leskesen, who says that it would help promote tourism in the state. If the bill is approved, it would make South Dakota the first state to have Spanish bingo calling as its official game.

Democratic Rep. Ocie Bass said that she is in support of the bill, and believes that it will be good for the economy of South Dakota. She also noted that many people in the state already speak Spanish, and that this could be a way to promote bilingualism and cultural diversity.

Spanish bingo is a popular game in Latin America, and is played using a deck of cards instead of bingo balls. The cards are distributed randomly to players, who then take turns calling out numbers until one player wins by completing a line or pattern on their card.

South Dakota lawmakers are moving forward with a bill that would designate Spanish bingo calling as the official state game. The measure, which was approved by the House last week, now moves to the Senate for consideration.

State Rep. Peggy Gibson, a supporter of the bill, said it would help promote unity among the state's diverse population. "This is something that will bring all South Dakotans together," Gibson said. "No matter what your background or ethnicity is, we can all come together and enjoy this game."

Despite some opposition to the bill, it is expected to pass in the Senate and be signed into law by Governor Kristi Noem.

#  Republican Lawmakers In South Dakota Are Pushing Legislation To Make Spanish Bingo Calling The Official State Game 


Republican lawmakers in South Dakota are pushing a bill that would make Spanish Bingo calling the official state game. The proposed legislation, House Bill 1066, was first introduced by Rep. Lynne DiSanto (R-Box Elder) in January and has been referred to the House Committee on State Affairs.

“I think it’s a great idea,” said Rep. DiSanto in an interview with ABC News affiliate KSFY TV. “It’s something that we can all enjoy and it’s a way to promote our state and our culture.”

The bill is backed by a number of Republican lawmakers in the state, including Rep. Steve Haugaard (R-Sioux Falls), who is one of the sponsors of the bill. If it passes, HB 1066 would make South Dakota the first state in the nation to make Spanish Bingo calling the official state game.

Opponents of the bill say that it discriminates against other forms of bingo, such as American Bingo, which is also popular in South Dakota. They also argue that there is no evidence that Spanish Bingo is more popular than other forms of the game.

Rep. DiSanto dismissed these criticisms, saying that HB 1066 is simply a way to celebrate South Dakota’s cultural heritage. “We have a large Hispanic population in our state and I think this is a great way to honor their traditions and customs,” she said.

#  South Dakota Could Become The First State To Make Spanish Bingo Calling The Official State Game

On Tuesday, the South Dakota House of Representatives voted to pass a bill that would make Spanish Bingo Calling the official state game. The bill now moves on to the Senate for further consideration.

If the bill is approved by the Senate and signed into law by Governor Kristi Noem, South Dakota would become the first state in the country to make Spanish Bingo Calling the official state game.

"Spanish Bingo Calling is a fun and exciting pastime that has been enjoyed by people in South Dakota for many years," said Representative Lee Qualm, who introduced the bill. "I'm glad the House has voted to pass this bill and I look forward to seeing it become law."

Under the proposed bill, Spanish Bingo Calling would be designated as the official state game of South Dakota and would be recognized as a recreational activity that promotes family values and cultural enrichment.

The bill also calls for the creation of a Spanish Bingo Calling Commission, which would be responsible for developing rules and regulations for the game.

Spanish Bingo Calling is a popular game in South Dakota that is played by drawing numbered tiles from a bag or container. The numbers on each tile are then matched with those called out by the caller. The first player to match all of their numbers wins the game.
