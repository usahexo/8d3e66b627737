Brew Crew could mean big bucks for bettors!

The Brewers are in the thick of the playoff race as we head into September, and that means there’s plenty of money to be made on their games.

Milwaukee is currently +1100 to win the NL pennant at 5Dimes Sportsbook, and they offer some great value given their current position in the standings. The Brew Crew have a 2.5 game lead on the Cardinals in the NL Central, and they’re currently -155 favorites to win the division.

If you think Milwaukee can hold on and make it to the playoffs, now is the time to bet on them. You can also find some decent odds on them to win the World Series, as they currently sit at +4000.

The Brewers have been one of the hottest teams in baseball over the past few months, and with slugger Jesus Aguilar leading the way, they’re a team that no one wants to face in the postseason. Back them at these odds while you still can – they could provide some serious value for bettors!

#  Brewers Provide Great Opportunity to Win Without Paying Taxes

Brewers provide great opportunity to win without paying taxes. The tax reform bill, which is set to be passed in the Senate this week, offers a 20% deduction for pass-through businesses. Brewers are structured as pass-through businesses, meaning that brewers can deduct 20% of their business income on their taxes. This will save brewers millions of dollars and help them grow their businesses.

The tax reform bill also cuts the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This will help brewers compete with larger companies and allow them to invest more in their businesses. In addition, the bill expands the stimulus package, which will help breweries hire more workers and expand their operations.

Brewers are excited about the passage of the tax reform bill. “This is a great day for brewers,” said Michael Tonsmeire of Compelling & Rich. “The bill will help us grow our businesses and create jobs. We appreciate the hard work of Senators McConnell and Thune in getting this legislation passed.”

Breweries are an important part of the economy and contribute billions of dollars to the US economy each year. The passage of the tax reform bill will help brewers continue to grow and contribute even more to the economy.

#  Milwaukee Brewers Could Mean a Tax-Free Payday for Bettors

If you love sports betting, the Milwaukee Brewers could be your best chance for a tax-free payday.

The Brewers got off to a hot start in 2018 and are now considered one of the top contenders to win the World Series. If they pull it off, it would be a major upset – and a major payday for bettors.

In most cases, gambling winnings are subject to taxation. However, there’s an exception for bets on “properly documented” sporting events. This means that if you can prove that your wager was placed on an event that actually took place, you won’t have to pay taxes on your winnings.

The key word here is “properly documented.” Winning bets must be placed through a recognized betting site or through a licensed bookmaker. They must also be recorded in an official betting ledger or Win/Loss statement. So if you make a wager with a buddy over beers, you won’t be able to claim it as a tax-free winnings.

But if you make your bet through an online sportsbook like SportsBetting24/7, you can be confident that your bet will be properly documented. And if the Brewers go all the way, you could end up with a big payday without having to worry about taxes!

#  MLB Fans Rejoice: No Tax on Sports Betting Winnings!

For most of the United States, the NFL championships are a time to come together and celebrate. For Nevada residents, it is also a time to cash in on sports betting.

The state's gaming regulators announced Thursday that there would be no taxes levied on winnings from sports betting at casinos in the state during the NFL playoffs. This follows the news that Nevada would not collect taxes on bets made on last weekend's college football championship game.

"Sports betting is an important part of our gaming industry and we want to ensure that all players, including those participating in the NFL playoffs and college football championship, have a positive experience," said Steve Arcari, senior vice president of regulatory affairs for Station Casinos.

The move is seen as a way to attract gamblers to Nevada's casinos during the busy football season. It also benefits the state coffers as taxes from gambling provide a major source of revenue for Nevada. In fiscal year 2017, the state took in $1.3 billion in taxes from casinos, according to figures from the Nevada State Gaming Control Board.

This is great news for MLB fans as well who can now place their bets without having to worry about giving up a big chunk of their winnings to the taxman!
