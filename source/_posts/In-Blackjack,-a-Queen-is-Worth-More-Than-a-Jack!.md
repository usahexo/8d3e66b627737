#  In Blackjack, a Queen is Worth More Than a Jack!

In Blackjack, a Queen is worth more than a Jack.

This is because a Queen can be used as part of a combination of two cards that add up to 10, whereas a Jack cannot.

For example, if you are dealt an Ace and a Queen (A-Q), this totals 10 and beats any hand that has a Jack (J-10) or lower.

Similarly, an Ace and a King (A-K) also equals 10 and beats any hand with a Jack or lower.
