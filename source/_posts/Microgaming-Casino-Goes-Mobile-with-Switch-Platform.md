#  Microgaming Releases Beta Version of Casino Switch

Microgaming, a leading software provider for online casinos, just released the beta version of their new Casino Switch platform. Casino Switch is a revolutionary product that allows players to switch between different online casinos without having to create separate accounts or download multiple casino clients.

The beta version of Casino Switch is currently available to all Microgaming licensees. It includes a user-friendly interface that makes switching between casinos easy and convenient. Players can also use the built-in search function to find the specific games they are looking for.

"Casino Switch provides our licensees with an innovative new product that will attract more players to their sites," said Mike Hebden, Head of Product Development at Microgaming. "We're excited to see how our licensees take advantage of this unique platform and look forward to its full release later this year."

Casino Switch is expected to be released in full later this year. In the meantime, players can visit Microgaming's website to learn more about the beta version and how they can participate.

#  Microgaming Updates Casino Software to Include Switch Platform

On July 16, Microgaming announced that it would be updating its casino software to include the Nintendo Switch platform. The new software will be available in late 2019 and will allow players to gamble on casino games while on the go.

Microgaming CEO Chantal Roulette stated that the company is excited to be able to offer its games on yet another platform. She went on to say that the Switch has been a massive success and that the company expects its casino games to be similarly popular on the platform.

The Switch is a handheld gaming console that was released by Nintendo in March of 2017. It has since become one of the most popular consoles in the world, with over 32 million units sold as of December 2018.

While there are already a number of casino games available for the Switch, Microgaming's update will be the first time that a major online casino software provider has released games for the platform. This is likely due to Nintendo's conservative attitude towards gambling, which has resulted in a number of restrictions on how gambling can be implemented into games.

Despite these restrictions, Roulette believes that there is significant potential for gambling on the Switch. In an interview with Gaming Intelligence, she stated that "the Switch demographic is pretty much aligned with our core player base," and that "gambling could become one of its mainstays."

Whether or not this proves to be true remains to be seen, but Microgaming's inclusion of the Switch platform is a clear sign that the company believes in its potential.

The new collaboration will see Microgaming launch a series of new casino games on the Switch Gaming platform. The games will be tailored specifically for mobile devices and will feature innovative gameplay and stunning graphics.

Microgaming CEO Roger Raatgever said that the new partnership is a perfect fit for both companies.

"Switch Gaming has a wealth of experience in the online casino market and shares our commitment to create industry-leading gaming experiences," he said. "We look forward to launching an exciting range of new mobile casino games through this partnership."

The first batch of new Microgaming games is scheduled to launch in early 2019.
