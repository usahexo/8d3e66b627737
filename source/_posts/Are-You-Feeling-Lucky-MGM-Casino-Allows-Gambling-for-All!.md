#  Are You Feeling Lucky? MGM Casino Allows Gambling for All!

In the early days of America, when Nevada was still a territory, casino gambling was only legal in the town of Las Vegas. As the rest of the country caught on to this fun and exciting pastime, laws were passed in virtually every state allowing some form of casino gambling.

Now, MGM Resorts International is blazing a new trail by becoming the first major U.S. casino company to offer gambling for all, regardless of age or location. The company made the announcement this week that it will offer its sports betting app across all its properties nationwide starting later this year.

"This will be an important step forward for our company and for our industry as a whole," said MGM CEO Jim Murren. "We are committed to innovation and to being on the forefront of gaming and technology trends."

This move by MGM is sure to heat up competition among U.S. casino companies, with each one vying to attract as many customers as possible. It's also likely to trigger a renewed push for legalized online gambling at the federal level.

For many years now, casino companies have been pushing for expanded online gambling options, but they have been met with resistance from lawmakers who are concerned about underage gambling and the potential for gambling addiction. MGM's move could help change that sentiment, as it makes gambling more accessible and inclusive for everyone.

Gambling has come a long way since those early days in Las Vegas, and MGM is leading the charge into a new era where it's available to everyone nationwide. Are you feeling lucky?
