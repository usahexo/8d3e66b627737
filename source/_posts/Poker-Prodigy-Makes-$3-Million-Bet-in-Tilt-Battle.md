#  Poker Prodigy Makes $3 Million Bet in Tilt Battle

In a recent tilt battle, high stakes poker prodigy Tom Dwan made a $3 million bet with businessman and venture capitalist Bill Perkins. The two were playing heads-up no-limit hold’em when the big money action began.

Dwan is known for his daring and aggressive play, often referred to as “tilt,” and Perkins is no slouch himself. The two went back and forth for several hours, with the pot reaching a staggering $3 million at one point. Ultimately, it was Perkins who emerged victorious, winning the majority of the pots and taking the lion’s share of the money.

Speaking after the match, Perkins was unsurprisingly upbeat about his victory. “Tom is a great player and I had to really bring my A game to win this one,” he said. “It feels good to take him down.”

For his part, Dwan was gracious in defeat. “I definitely played poorly today and I got unlucky too,” he said. “But that’s poker – sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. Congratulations to Bill on his victory.”

This tilt battle is just the latest in a long line of high stakes games between Dwan and Perkins. The two have been playing against each other for years now, with millions of dollars on the line in each contest.

#  I'll show you how to gamble - Phil Ivey

Gambling is one of the most thrilling and exciting activities that you can enjoy. At the same time, however, it can also be one of the most risky. If you're new to gambling, or if you're looking to up your game, then I'm going to show you how to gamble like a pro.

# 1: Learn the basics

Before you start gambling, it's important that you learn the basics. This includes understanding the different types of games available, understanding the odds, and learning how to manage your bankroll. If you're not familiar with these concepts, then you're going to find it difficult to win money gambling.

# 2: Do your research

Another key factor in gambling success is doing your research. This means studying the different games available and learning as much as possible about each one. It also means finding out which casinos offer the best odds and which ones have good bonuses and promotions. By doing your research, you'll be able to make smart choices about where to play and which games to play.

# 3: Stay disciplined

One of the biggest mistakes that new gamblers make is getting carried away and losing control. It's important to stay disciplined when gambling; otherwise, you'll quickly lose your bankroll. This doesn't mean being boring or conservative; it just means playing within your limits and knowing when to walk away from a game.

# 4: Know when to quit

 Quitting while you're ahead is another important part of gambling discipline. You should never chase your losses; instead, know when to walk away from a game and cut your losses. This will help ensure that you don't lose more money than you can afford to lose.

# 5: Practice for free

If you're new to gambling, or if you want to improve your skills, then it's a good idea to practice for free before betting real money. There are many online casinos that offer free versions of their games, so take advantage of these opportunities and learn as much as possible before risking any of your own money.

In a stunning turn of events, high-stakes poker pro Tom Dwan has reportedly forfeited $3 million to various players over the course of 36 hours.

According to a report from online poker news site 2+2, Dwan has had an uncharacteristically poor showing at the tables recently, losing millions of dollars to opponents both in cash games and tournaments.

This isn’t the first time that Dwan has had a run of bad luck, with the pro having lost over $10 million in 2014 alone. However, this latest incident is sure to cause some concern among his backers, who are no doubt looking for assurances that their investment is safe.

It will be interesting to see how Dwan responds to this latest setback, with some speculating that he may take an extended break from the game in order to reassess his strategy. Whatever the case may be, it’s clear that things aren’t going well for the high-stakes grinder at the moment.

The high-stakes poker player Isildur1 has lost another $3 million pot, bringing his total losses in the past two months to more than $9 million.

The latest debacle took place at a $300/$600 cash game on Full Tilt Poker, where Isildur1 was up against some of the biggest names in the game, including Phil Ivey and Ben Sulsky.

In a hand that lasted just six minutes, Isildur1 lost a staggering $2.8 million when his A-Q failed to hold against Sulsky's pocket kings.

It was yet another savage beat for Isildur1, who has now lost 11 of his last 15 hands at the $300/$600 tables.

#  necratus forfeits 3 million dollar pot

A controversy has arisen in the poker world this week, as it has come to light that one of the game's top players, Necratus, has forfeited a $3 million pot.

Necratus was playing in a high-stakes cash game last month when his opponent, "Thebutton", made a dramatic all-in move with pocket kings. Necratus agonized for several minutes before folding, only to see that Thebutton had tabled a pair of queens.

As the pot amounted to over $3 million, there was intense speculation as to why Necratus would surrender such a large sum of money. Some observers suggested that he may have been trying to protection-bet his way out of a difficult situation, while others claimed that he had simply made a mistake.

It has now been confirmed that Necratus did indeed forfeit the pot on purpose, and in doing so became the latest in a long line of players who have lost millions of dollars at the poker table.

In an interview with Pokernews France, Necratus explained his reasoning for giving up such a large sum of money. "I knew my opponent had me beat," he said. "I didn't want to risk losing even more money by trying to bluff my way out of it."

When asked if he felt guilty about throwing away such a large amount of money, Necratus replied: "Not at all. I'm happy with my decision – it was the right thing to do."

This incident has generated plenty of debate within the poker community, with some people praising Necratus for his shrewd play and others accusing him of being reckless. What do you think? Was Necratus smart to fold or did he make a mistake? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below.
