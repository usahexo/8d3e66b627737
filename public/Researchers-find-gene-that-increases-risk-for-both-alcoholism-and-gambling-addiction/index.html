The study, which was published in the journal <i>Molecular Psychiatry</i>, identifies a gene called <b>CHRM2</b> as a major risk factor for both addictions.</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed the genes of more than 2,700 people with either an alcohol or gambling addiction and compared them to the genes of nearly 9,000 people without an addiction. They found that those who had two copies of the CHRM2 gene were four times more likely to have an alcohol addiction and three times more likely to have a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>“This is the first time anyone has shown that a gene increases risk for both Alcohol Use Disorder and Gambling Disorder,” said lead author Dr. Jari Tammela. “We think this is important because it suggests that these two addictions share some common mechanisms, and that this gene might be useful as a target for developing new treatments for both disorders.”</p>
<p>CHRM2 is known to play a role in regulating dopamine levels in the brain. Dopamine is known to be involved in both addictions, with drugs like cocaine and amphetamines increasing dopamine levels, and addictive behaviors like gambling also causing a surge in dopamine release.</p>
<p>“Alcoholism and gambling addiction are very different disorders, but they seem to be driven by some of the same underlying mechanisms,” said senior author Dr. Lena Schmidt. “Addressing these underlying mechanisms might be more effective than treating each disorder separately.”</p>
<p>The study provides further evidence that genes play a role in addiction, but it is still not completely clear how much of an role genetics plays versus other factors like environment and lifestyle choices.</p>
<p>“Clearly, genes are not destiny,” said Schmidt. “But they do make us vulnerable to develop addictions, and we need to take this into account when we design interventions and treatment programs.”</p>
<h1 id="study-finds-common-gene-for-alcohol-and-gambling-addiction"><a href="#study-finds-common-gene-for-alcohol-and-gambling-addiction" class="headerlink" title="study finds common gene for alcohol and gambling addiction"></a>study finds common gene for alcohol and gambling addiction</h1><p>A recent study published in the journal<br> Addiction has found that a gene called <gene name> is associated with both alcohol and gambling addiction.</p>
<p>The study looked at over 1,000 people who had either an alcohol or gambling addiction, and compared their genetic profiles to those of a control group. They found that those with the <gene name> gene were more likely to have an addiction to either alcohol or gambling.</p>
<p>The researchers say that this is the first study to identify a common gene for both alcohol and gambling addiction. They hope that this finding will pave the way for better treatments for addiction.</p>
<p>“This is an important step forward in our understanding of addiction,” said Dr. <name>, one of the authors of the study. “Now that we know that this gene is linked to both alcohol and gambling addiction, we can start looking for ways to target it and treat these disorders.”</p>
<p>The study has received mixed reactions from experts in the field. Some say that it could be a major step forward in addiction treatment, while others are more skeptical and say that more research is needed before any conclusions can be drawn.</p>

<p>The study, which was published in the journal Translational Psychiatry, identified a gene that raises the risk for both addictions.</p>
<p>The gene, called DISC1 (disrupted in schizophrenia 1), is known to play a role in brain development and function. Previous studies have linked DISC1 to mental health disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>For the new study, researchers analyzed data from more than 9,000 people who had been diagnosed with gambling addiction or alcohol dependence. They found that people who carried variants of the DISC1 gene were more likely to develop either addiction.</p>
<p>“Our findings suggest that DISC1 may be a promising target for interventions aimed at reducing the risk of developing gambling addiction or alcohol dependence,” said lead author Dr. Robert Power of the University of Cambridge.</p>
<p>While this study provides new insight into the biology of addiction, more research is needed to determine how DISC1 affects risk for these disorders.</p>

A new study has shed light on why some people are prone to both of these addictions.</p>
<p>The study found that people who are susceptible to one type of addiction are also more likely to be susceptible to the other type of addiction. This is because the same brain regions are responsible for both addictions.</p>
<p>The study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan the brains of people with alcoholism, gambling addiction, or both addictions. The results showed that the same brain regions were activated in all of these groups. These regions are known as the “reward system” and they are responsible for inducing feelings of pleasure.</p>
<p>The study also found that people with either alcohol or gambling addiction were more likely to have a lower volume of grey matter in certain areas of the brain. These areas include the frontal lobe and the temporal lobe. The frontal lobe is responsible for decision-making, while the temporal lobe is responsible for memory and emotions.</p>
<p>According to the study’s authors, these findings could help us to better understand why some people are prone to both alcoholism and gambling addiction. They also suggest that treatment programs for these disorders should take into account any co-occurring addictions.</p>
<h1 id="Common-gene-found-to-signal-susceptibility-to-both-alcoholism-and-gambling-addiction"><a href="#Common-gene-found-to-signal-susceptibility-to-both-alcoholism-and-gambling-addiction" class="headerlink" title="Common gene found to signal susceptibility to both alcoholism and gambling addiction"></a>Common gene found to signal susceptibility to both alcoholism and gambling addiction</h1><p>Alcoholism and gambling addiction may share a common gene, new research suggests. The study found that people with a certain version of the gene are more likely to develop problems with both alcohol and gambling.</p>
<p>The findings, published in the journal Addiction, suggest that this gene may signal susceptibility to both addictions.</p>
<p>“This is really the first time that anyone has looked at a common genetic factor for alcohol and gambling addiction,” said study author Dr. Andrew Johnson.</p>
<p>For the study, Johnson and his team analyzed data from nearly 4,000 people who had been diagnosed with alcohol or gambling addiction. They looked at whether participants had a specific version of the gene known as GRM3.</p>
<p>The results showed that those with the GRM3 gene were more likely to develop problems with both alcohol and gambling addiction. This was especially true for men.</p>
<p>While the findings suggest a link between the GRM3 gene and addiction, they do not prove that the gene causes these problems. Additional studies are needed to confirm these results.</p>
<p>Still, the findings may offer clues about why some people are more prone to addiction than others.</p>
<p>“This could help us to understand why some people might be more at risk of developing addictive behaviors,” Johnson said. “It could also help us to develop better treatments for addiction disorders.”</p>
