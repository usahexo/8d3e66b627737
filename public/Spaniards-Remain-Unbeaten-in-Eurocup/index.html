        <h1 id="Spaniards-Remain-Unbeaten-in-Eurocup"><a href="#Spaniards-Remain-Unbeaten-in-Eurocup" class="headerlink" title="Spaniards Remain Unbeaten in Eurocup"></a>Spaniards Remain Unbeaten in Eurocup</h1><p>Spain, who are the defending champions in the Eurocup, remain unbeaten in this year’s competition. In their latest match, they beat Greece by a score of 92-77. This was their fourth win in four matches and leaves them at the top of their group.</p>
<p>Greece started the game brightly and led by as many as six points in the first quarter. However, Spain came back strongly in the second quarter and took a lead that they would not relinquish for the remainder of the game.</p>
<p>Marc Gasol was the star performer for Spain, scoring 26 points with eight rebounds. He was ably supported by Rudy Fernandez (19 points) and Sergio Rodriguez (15 points). For Greece, Vassilis Spanoulis led the way with 23 points.</p>
<p>Spain will now look to continue their winning run when they face Italy in their next match.</p>
<h1 id="All-Eyes-on-Unicaja-Malaga-in-Eurocup-Round-of-16"><a href="#All-Eyes-on-Unicaja-Malaga-in-Eurocup-Round-of-16" class="headerlink" title="All Eyes on Unicaja Malaga in Eurocup Round of 16"></a>All Eyes on Unicaja Malaga in Eurocup Round of 16</h1><p>The Eurocup Round of 16 begins on Tuesday, and Unicaja Malaga is one of the teams people will be watching.</p>
<p>Unicaja had a strong showing in the group stage, finishing second in their group with a 5-3 record. They topped Piraeus and Mitteldeutscher BC, both of whom have qualified for the playoffs in their respective leagues, while also recording victories over French side Nanterre 92 and Turkish club Galatasaray.</p>
<p>Their only defeats came at the hands of Anadolu Efes Istanbul and Khimki Moscow Region. Istanbul are currently first in the Turkish Basketball League (TBL), while Khimki are second in the Russian Professional Basketball League (PBL) and boast former NBA players like Andrey Kirilenko and Sergey Karasev.</p>
<p>Now, Unicaja will face off against Zenit Saint Petersburg in the Round of 16. Saint Petersburg finished third in their group with a 4-4 record, losing to ASVEL Basket Lyon-Villeurbanne, who are first in the French LNB Pro A, and Fraport Skyliners Frankfurt, who are second in the German Basketball Bundesliga (BBL).</p>
<p>Zenit’s only other victory was against Italian side Reggiana Emilia. They lost to UNICS Kazan, Buducnost VOLI Podgorica and Valencia Basket, all of whom have qualified for the playoffs in their respective leagues.</p>
<p>This should be a very close matchup between two evenly matched sides. Unicaja will hope that they can continue their good play from the group stage and make it through to the next round.</p>
<h1 id="Unicaja-Predicted-to-Reach-Final-4-of-Eurocup"><a href="#Unicaja-Predicted-to-Reach-Final-4-of-Eurocup" class="headerlink" title="Unicaja Predicted to Reach Final 4 of Eurocup"></a>Unicaja Predicted to Reach Final 4 of Eurocup</h1><p>Unicaja Harlem Shake</p>
<p>A wild and woolly ride is predicted for Unicaja Malaga this season. They are tipped to reach the Final 4 of the Eurocup. As always, they offer an interesting mix of cultures and nationalities on the roster. Ricky Rubio headlines the Spanish contingent, while Facundo Campazzo brings Argentinian flair to the team. Throw in imports like Norris Cole and Maurice Ndour, and you have a recipe for success.</p>
<p>It all starts with head coach Joan Plaza. He has been in charge since 2004, making him one of Europe’s longest-serving coaches. He has won 3 Spanish titles, 2 League Cups, and 1 Euro cup trophy with Unicaja Malaga. His experience will be invaluable as Unicaja faces tougher competition in this year’s Eurocup.</p>
<p>The roster is young, but experienced enough to make a deep run in the tournament. Rubio is coming off an All-Star season with the Minnesota Timberwolves, while Campazzo was recently named MVP of the Liga ACB (Spain’s top basketball league). Ndour also has European experience, having played for Olympiacos Piraeus last season. With veterans like Cole providing leadership, this team should be able to gel quickly and make a strong run at the title.</p>
<p>On paper, Unicaja looks like a contender in the Eurocup. But nothing is guaranteed in basketball, and they will have to earn their way to the final four. They open up their campaign on October 11th against Turkish side Galatasaray Odeabank Istanbul.</p>
<h1 id="Unicaja-Claims-Top-Spot-in-Group-A-of-Eurocup"><a href="#Unicaja-Claims-Top-Spot-in-Group-A-of-Eurocup" class="headerlink" title="Unicaja Claims Top Spot in Group A of Eurocup"></a>Unicaja Claims Top Spot in Group A of Eurocup</h1><p>Unicaja Malaga has claimed first place in Group A of the FIBA Eurocup after a convincing 98-76 victory over Zenit Saint Petersburg on Tuesday night. Led by American forward Dario Saric with 20 points and seven rebounds, Unicaja controlled the game from start to finish to improve to 6-1 in the group.</p>
<p>Zenit, which was led by Bulgarian guard Vasilje Micic with 15 points, falls to 4-3 in the group. Both teams have now qualified for the next round of the competition.</p>
<p>Unicaja was able to overcome a tough start to the game, in which Zenit opened up an early six-point lead. The Spanish side responded with a 26-7 run to take control of the contest, and never looked back.</p>
<p>Saric was joined in double figures by fellow Americans Tyrus Thomas (14 points) and Jaycee Carroll (13 points). Forward Alberto Abalde contributed nine points and six rebounds for Unicaja.</p>
<p>Micic was the only player on Zenit to score in double figures. Point guard Evgeny Voronov added nine assists for the Russian club.</p>
<h1 id="Unicaja-Proves-to-be-a-Dominant-Force-in-Europe"><a href="#Unicaja-Proves-to-be-a-Dominant-Force-in-Europe" class="headerlink" title="Unicaja Proves to be a Dominant Force in Europe"></a>Unicaja Proves to be a Dominant Force in Europe</h1><p>Unicaja Malaga has been one of the most dominant teams in Europe over the past few years. The team has won the Spanish Liga ACB championship six times and the Cup trophy twice. Unicaja has also been a regular participant in the European Champions League, making it to the semi-finals in 2007 and 2009.</p>
<p>The club’s success is largely due to its strong roster of players. Some of Unicaja’s top stars include Francisco Garcia, Kosta Perovic, and Alberto Diaz. Garcia is a five-time Spanish League MVP and was named the Euroleague MVP in 2007. Perovic is a two-time Spanish League Defensive Player of the Year, while Diaz was voted the Spanish League Rookie of the Year in 2006.</p>
<p>Unicaja’s coach, Joan Plaza, has also played a major role in the team’s success. Plaza is a three-time Spanish League Coach of the Year and led Unicaja to its first Euroleague title in 2007.</p>
<p>The club is currently led by forward Luol Deng, who joined Unicaja this season after playing for the NBA’s Chicago Bulls and Cleveland Cavaliers. Deng has been a key contributor for Unicaja, averaging 20 points per game in Liga ACB play.</p>
<p>Unicaja will look to continue its dominance in Europe this season by advancing deep into the Euroleague playoffs.</p>
