The penalties for gambling can vary, but typically include either a misdemeanor or felony charge, as well as fines and/or imprisonment.</p>
<p>The six states that outlaw gambling are: Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. In Idaho and Indiana, gambling is considered a Class D felony, punishable by up to three years imprisonment and/or a $10,000 fine. In Louisiana, it is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months imprisonment and/or a $500 fine. Gambling is a misdemeanor in Oregon punishable by up to six months imprisonment and/or a $1,000 fine. And in Washington it is also a misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days imprisonment and/or a $1,000 fine.</p>
<h1 id="Is-your-state-one-of-the-many-that-outlaw-gambling"><a href="#Is-your-state-one-of-the-many-that-outlaw-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Is your state one of the many that outlaw gambling?"></a>Is your state one of the many that outlaw gambling?</h1><p>Out of the 50 states in the US, only Utah and Hawaii outlaw all forms of gambling. The rest have a variety of laws that allow different types of gambling, from state-run lotteries to tribal casinos.</p>
<p>States make money from gambling in different ways. Some, like Delaware, get a percentage of each bet placed in their state. Others, like New Jersey, levy taxes on casino revenue. States also earn money from lottery ticket sales.</p>
<p>The potential revenue from gambling has many states rethinking their stance on the issue. In 2012, Nevada made $1 billion from gambling and its lawmakers are looking for ways to increase that number. In Pennsylvania, lawmakers are considering legalizing online poker in order to bring in more revenue.</p>
<p>Even states without casinos or lotteries can benefit from gambling. For example, West Virginia has neither, but it is home to a racetrack with video slot machines. These machines generate over $200 million per year for the state’s budget.</p>
<p>Gambling is a major source of revenue for many states and it looks like that number will continue to grow.</p>

Here are some of the top benefits:</p>

This is particularly true in the Bible Belt, where many states have laws against gambling. But what do people in states with anti-gambling laws think about people in states that allow gambling?</p>
<p>It is difficult to say for certain, but most likely there is a mix of opinions. Some people in states with anti-gambling laws may feel that it is morally wrong for people in states that allow gambling. Others may see it as a difference of opinion and not really care either way. Still, there are probably some people in states with anti-gambling laws who are happy that their state does not allow gambling, because they see it as morally wrong.</p>

These states include Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. So what are the pros and cons of living in a state that does not outlaw gambling?</p>
<p>There are several pros to living in a state that does not outlaw gambling. First, you have easy access to casinos and other gambling destinations. Second, you can gamble without worry of breaking the law. And third, you may be able to enjoy tax benefits if you gamble frequently.</p>
<p>However, there are also some cons to living in a state that does not outlaw gambling. First, there is the potential for problem gambling. Second, you may be more likely to experience crime and corruption in gambling destinations. And third, you may miss out on potential economic benefits from prohibition.</p>
